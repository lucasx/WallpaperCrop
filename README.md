# WallpaperCrop
A Windows WPF application for basic image editing on wallpapers.

Written in C#.

Created by lucasx.

This application was created for the ease of those select few who care much more than the should about the quality of their computer desktop
wallpapers, yet have multi-monitor setups and have trouble coming across wallpapers with an acceptable resolution.

Use this application to resize, zoom, crop, pad, and convert images before using them as wallpapers.

## Current Limitations
Cannot export images that do not entirely fill the full size of the wallpaper.
This application currently only runs well on triple-monitor setups of three screens each with resolution 1920x1080.

## Functionality so far
-Controls window to manipulate the image; Preview window to view full-size image

-Select an image using the Import Image... button

-Pan around image by clicking/dragging the image in the preview window

-Recenter image using the recenter button

-Temporarily hide the controls window by holding down 'Q'.

-Move the controls window to the opposite screen by pressing Tab.

-When you're satisfied with the preview, click Export wallpaper... to save a png of the new image.

-Press Esc to close the application.

This application is far from complete - much more to come in the future.
